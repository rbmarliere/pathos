    "pathos": "Pathos is Brazilian a band from Minas Gerais, formed in 2014 and composed of Hugo Moutinho, JP Vieira, Lucas Guida, Luiz Andrès and Ricardo Marlière.",
    "p1": "pa·thos",
    "p2": "/'pā.THäs/",
    "def1": "quality in writing, speaking, musicing or artistic representation (and, by extension, in facts, circumstances, people) that stimulates the feeling of pity or sadness; power of touching the feeling of melancholy or that of tenderness; touching or pathetic character or influence.",
    "def2": "in the experience of the spectator, reader, etc., a feeling of pity, compassion or empathy created by this quality of the text, music, representation, etc.",
    "def3": "esp. in ancient Greek art, quality of what is transient or emotional (eg to the permanent or ideal).",
    "def4": "in Aristotle's rhetoric, pathos, ethos and logos are the three fundamental pillars. Ethos appeals to ethics, pathos to feeling or to emotions, and logos to logic.",

    "p3": "In 2015 their debut album was released, entitled Elixir. At that time, everything was new to everyone: barely any member had ever entered a studio to record an album, but they accepted the challenge. Elixir was recorded in just two days, February 21 and 22, 2015, and released on August 6 of that year.",
    "p4": "Shortly after the release of the album, the band entered a hiatus, which lasted little more than a year, due to two of its members travelling abroad to fulfill their college needs. When they finally returned, Luiz Andrès joined the group, and then the process of composing the new album had began.",
    "p5": "Rapture was recorded in July 2018, at Sonastério (Belo Horizonte, MG - Brazil), and released on March 20, 2019, during the Equinox.",
    "p6": "Rapture is the ecstasy and catharsis that takes the body after the consumption of the Elixir. It is the natural sequence of events, a continuation of what has already been initiated.",
    "p7": "In the present album, the band tried to walk in ways similar to the ones of the Elixir, but it didn`t prevent them of adventuring in new ones, in addition of looking for lines of compositions that were more connected. Dualities, catastrophes and love (always love) are recurring themes in the lyrics of this album. Rapture arrives as an affirmation of Pathos, showing that they have found their place and that this place is new but anachronistic, because the air that breathes in it seems the same air of decades ago. With you, Pathos' newest album.",

    "dan": "From there, the next songs would be like many other portals, like the one that Herman Hesse talks about while describing the Theater that his character finds.",
