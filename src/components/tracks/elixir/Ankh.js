                    In this world I was born
                    Spitted in fire
                    Through my birth in death
                    I have emerged
                    and now I’m alive

                    With my golden armor
                    Smoky spear in my hand
                    I’ll be going to war
                    Towards your faith
                    To rip your flesh from inside

                    Take my blinding light
                    Eat and drink it or leave
                    Then gain my trembling strength
                    Go on now and
                    Try to do it again

                    I have a hunger for fear
                    Show me where does it hide
                    I will strike with my sword
                    Shining with blood
                    Since there is no god where I am
                    Where am I?

                    In a moment in eternity I saw a tear
                    Rolling down your face
                    You seem so distant to me yet standing so near
                    Oh, my dear
                    I wish we could be one again
                    I will hit you hard to see
                    If you can take my heart along with you

                    I am not allowed to die
                    I always change, I will born again
                    Infinite force I have within
                    In flames so high I’m burning inside

                    I will keep it up
                    I will keep it low
                    Try to keep on living
                    There is no other way
                    Keep on loving
